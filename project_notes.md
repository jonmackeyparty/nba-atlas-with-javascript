//Index Pages//

Button for "View Leagues" >> shows index of leagues via js on player show page

      --need to nest some html in the logic so jquery can find the dom element to attach the info to
        (or append to parent element)
        each element in the list should be be a link; once clicked, it can show the league detail

        ** be aware may need an explicit serializer for trimming data **

      --this will be an onclick --> get to the leagues controller
      --


refresh buttons for the 2 sections

make js load smoother (find some other way to load other than empty() and .append?)

  --is it ok to stick a bunch of stuff in the ajax:success?

convert active league link to display details via js to satisfy project requirements  (rather than going ahead and listing it)
